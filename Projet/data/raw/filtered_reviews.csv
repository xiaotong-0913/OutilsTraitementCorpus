The Lamplight Review",0.6,"If this is truly the end for the icon as Ethan Hunt, it could’ve been worse, but a cleaner story with a shorter runtime could’ve elevated the incredible stunt sequences rather than relying on them to shoulder the weight of the film."

Time Out
TOP CRITIC",0.8,"It’s a sweet, funny, simple story with a cute central duo and modest scale (thanks to a smaller than typical budget). It turns out to be an excellent candidate for a do-over, able to establish a personality of its own without the original looming over it."

Film Feeder",0.5,"Lilo & Stitch is a version of the animated original that simply exists, and nothing else. It does what it says on the tin, for better or worse, and leaves your mind as soon as it ends, with no other function than to generate its studio a ton of money."

Epoch Times",0.5,"Given the plethora of holes in the plot, I was certain the ending would follow suit or be far too pat and predictable, but I’m happy to report I was wrong. As it turns out, the ending is the best part of the entire movie, but it’s too little too late."

The Post NZ",0.7,Bloodlines is a respectful resurrection of a series that nurtured the careers of several young directors and filled cinemas for a decade with happy teens who got exactly what they were hoping to see. I reckon we should welcome its return.

Hey, Have You Seen ...?",0.7,"The back half unfolds at a fast pace—perhaps too fast. I think that's kind of the point as Kandhari is all about idiosyncratic juxtapositions with his soundtrack choices, use of animation, and dry humor in traditionally dark, dramatic scenarios."

Cambridge Day",0.62,"It’s a game, plucky performance by Sadeghian that anchors the film, while the edgy slide guitar score by Ethan Startzman goes far to help ratchet up the tension."
bound_2023,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bound_2023,"Debopriyaa Dutta
High on Films",0.5,"Even when Bound intermittently soars and lands on an emotion that rattles one’s core, it plummets right back into shallow waters, embracing an ethos that is painfully skin-deep."

Flickering Myth",0.8,"Bound is definitely a film worth checking out, with first-rate performances from top to bottom and an engaging and emotionally powerful story. Not always an easy watch with its hard-hitting themes, but the film has so much sincerity."

Film Focus Online",0.7,"The Severed Sun is a story of awakening. The horror is psychological as much as supernatural. This is a film about control; who has it, how they keep it, and what it takes to break free. The Severed Sun is a gripping horror, you must watch it!"
